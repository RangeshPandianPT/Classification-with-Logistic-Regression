##  🧪  Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression

This project implements a binary classification model using **Logistic Regression** on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**. It evaluates model performance using key metrics like **confusion matrix**, **precision**, **recall**, **ROC-AUC**, and explores **threshold tuning** to optimize predictions.

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- How to preprocess and standardize features
- Train/test split for model evaluation
- Fit a logistic regression classifier
- Use sigmoid function and decision thresholds
- Evaluate classification using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision & Recall
  - ROC-AUC Score
  - Threshold tuning
- Visualize model performance

---

## 📊 Results

- **Default Threshold (0.5)**:
  - Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC calculated
- **Tuned Threshold (0.3)**:
  - Improved sensitivity for medical application scenarios
